# Weather App

We were asked to work in pairs and to build a weather app using branches. 
we learned about using fetch functions in JS to get data from an API.


## The problem

We have googled, using stack overflow and chatGPT so solve our problems. 
We started to build the foundation of our app using liveshare in VSCode and then split up in branches. We did one part each of the task and then merged to do the last touches. 
We also used promises, fetch functions, json and http-methods to put the project together.

If we had more time we whould try to do the stretchgoals and add more cities to the app.
We also whould make the search-button work.
